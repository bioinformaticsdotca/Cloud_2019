The most current version of this introductory tutorial *RStudio project* lives at <https://github.com/hyginn/R-Intro>. You will be able to access it there for the forseeable future.  
  
1. Open RStudio.  
2. Select **File â†’ NewProject...**  
3. Click on **Version Control**.  
4. Click on **Git**.  
5. Enter <https://github.com/hyginn/R-Intro> as the Repository URL.  
6. Type a `<tab>` character, the Project directory name field should then autofill to read `R-Intro`.  
7. Click on **Browse...** to find your project directory. (You should have created a project directory. If you didn't, do it **now**). Click **Open**.  
8. Click **Create Project**; the project files should be downloaded and the console should prompt you to type `init()` to begin.  
9. Type `init() ` into the console pane.  

When you are done, place a _blue postIt_ on the lid of your laptop. Use a _red postIt_ if you have issues.  

We will be working with `mySequenceAnalysis.R`.
